## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css

# About

- This template aims to speed up setting up and working on a project by providing basic code that you can reuse in your works
- it uses Vite and Sass
- The Sass files organization is based on [the 7-1 pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern)

# How to use

- Once you have the template in your repos, you can use it as a base for your project

## With GitHub

1. Go to GitHub
2. Find the repo with the template
3. Click the **Use this template** button on the **Code** tab
4. Enter the name for a new repo with the project you're going to work on
5. Add the description if you want
6. Choose if you want it to be public or private
7. Click **Create repository from template** button
8. A new repo based on the template will be created

## With degit

1. Install [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit), if you don't have it yet

```
npm install -g degit
```

2. Open up the terminal and use:

```
degit github-user-name/template-mame my-new-project
```

where:

- `github-user-name` is the username you use on GitHub
- `template-name` is the name of the template that will be base of your project (such as `website-starter-react-template`)
- `my-new-project` name of the project you're going to work on

In my case the above could look the following:

```
degit ania221b/website-starter-react-template to-do-list
```

You can use the terminal in VS Code, Command Prompt, Windows Powershell or a tool like [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)

3. Navigate to your new project, so:

```
cd my-new-project
```

4. Perform the installation

```
npm install
```

5. Open your project up in VS code

```
code .
```
